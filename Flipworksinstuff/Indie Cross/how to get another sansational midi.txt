Now, this is to help skeech, since his goal is to reach 100 members on his server.


If you have discord, join his discord server: https://discord.com/invite/eb6mXrpMJX

If you're already in, go to the ¨midis¨ channel.

Being here, scroll to the first message of the channel, you will find a skeech message about the channel.

Behind that message, there are 2 files, the sans part and the bf part. Don't forget to download both!

With that, you already have the midi!
